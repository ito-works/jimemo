"""The boundary that makes deleting jimemo#y9p8's guard safe.

These tests exist to fail if the boundary stops being a boundary. The point
that matters is not that ``assert_interpreter_is_supported()`` raises when
called -- it is that **importing a module that lints cannot happen without it
raising**. So the important tests here run a FRESH PROCESS and really import
``jimemo.lint``; deleting the module-level call in ``lint.py`` makes them
fail, which a test that calls the function by hand would not.

The detection of a parser that misbehaves at or above the floor is NOT here
-- it is ``tests/test_lint.py``'s 318-case canary and the nine y9p8 payload
vectors. See ``src/jimemo/_parser_floor.py`` for why runtime probing was
tried and dropped.
