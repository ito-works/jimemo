# AGENTS.md

CLAUDE.md is a symlink to this file: the claude-glm lane cannot read AGENTS.md directly (jibot-code#1ea1); edit only AGENTS.md.

Instructions for any coding agent or harness (Claude Code, Codex, Cowork,
Amplifier, or a plain shell) working with jimemo. This is the CLI contract;
`README.md` is the human-facing tour and `docs/architecture.md` is the
module map for anyone changing jimemo's code.

## What this is

jimemo turns a template + a content file into one self-contained HTML
page — a briefing, dashboard, catalog, or timeline. Everything is stdlib
Python plus vendored dependencies: nothing to `pip install`, no network
access at render time. It also has an optional publish step for pushing a
rendered page to an unlisted private link.

## Install

```
git clone <this repo>
cd jimemo
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` writes `~/.local/bin/jimemo` as a small shell script bound
to one Python interpreter, chosen at install time and verified by running
it (candidates `python3`, `python3.13`, `python3.14` in that order;
override with `--python PATH` or `JIMEMO_PYTHON=PATH`), and registers
this skill (`skill/`) with any harness it finds installed (Claude Code,
Codex, ...). The installed `jimemo` runs that interpreter by absolute
path whatever the caller's `PATH` holds; if it is later removed or drops
below the floor, `jimemo` prints one line telling you to re-run
`./install.sh`, and `jimemo doctor` reports the binding. Idempotent, and
`./install.sh --uninstall` removes exactly what it wrote. One
clone; `git pull` updates every harness that points at it. Requires
Python >= 3.13.6, and a final release rather than a pre-release (3.14.0b1
sorts above the floor but still has the old parser). The floor is
patch-level: `html.parser` only stopped
disagreeing with a browser about attribute character references,
attribute splitting and unclosed `<style>` text in 3.13.4/3.13.6, and
`jimemo check` depends on that — see `src/jimemo/__init__.py`, and
`src/jimemo/_parser_floor.py` for what the floor does and does not
guarantee). A stock Mac's `/usr/bin/python3` is
3.9.6; `brew install python@3.13` and either put it first on `PATH` or
pass it to `install.sh --python`.

Without `install.sh`, the manual equivalent is a symlink:
`ln -s $(pwd)/jimemo ~/.local/bin/jimemo`. It binds no interpreter: it
runs whatever `python3` the calling shell resolves.

## Commands

Every subcommand has its own `--help`; this is the map, not the manual.

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `jimemo doctor` | checks Python version, vendor checksums, vendored imports, and stale suitability labels |
| `jimemo list` | lists installed templates (repo `templates/` + `~/.jimemo/templates/`) |
| `jimemo suggest <content> [--json]` | ranks templates by fit for a content file, with reasons |
| `jimemo info <template> [--json]` | shows a template's slot schema, components, charts, and suitability metadata |
| `jimemo render <template\|auto> <content> [-o OUT] [--theme NAME] [--open] [--pdf [PATH]]` | renders a template + content file to one HTML file; `auto` uses the same scorer as `suggest` and falls through to the next-best template if the top pick's manifest rejects the content; `-o` ending in `.pdf` writes only a PDF; `--theme light|dark` pins the output's color mode (any other NAME applies a theme override) |
| `jimemo check <file.html>` | verifies a rendered (possibly hand-tweaked) HTML file still meets the self-contained guarantee |
| `jimemo pdf <file.html> [-o OUT] [--no-verify]` | converts a rendered HTML file to PDF via a locally installed Chromium-family browser (Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Brave; override with `[pdf] browser` in `~/.jimemo/config.toml`) |
| `jimemo scaffold <template> [-o OUT]` | emits a fill-in content skeleton for a template's slots (.md frontmatter, or .yaml when the template has no body slot) |
| `jimemo new-template <name>` | scaffolds a personal template under `~/.jimemo/templates/<name>/` |
| `jimemo import-design <export-dir>\|--from NAME [--name NAME] [--embed-fonts]` | parses a Claude-design export into a jimemo theme at `~/.jimemo/themes/<name>.css`; `--from NAME` resolves `~/.jimemo/design-systems/NAME/` instead of a positional path |
| `jimemo publish <file>` / `purge <hash-or-url>` / `list` / `gc` / `setup [--dry-run]` | publishes a rendered file to an unlisted link and manages it; HTML files are re-verified for self-containment first (`--no-verify` skips); `setup` provisions a backend in `~/.jimemo/config.toml`; `--no-sync` skips the cloudflare backend's git state-dir sync for one deploy |

## The content contract

`jimemo info <template> --json` is the schema for that template: its
`slots` object gives each content field's `type` (`text`, `markdown`,
`data`) and whether it's `required`, plus `charts` (chart declarations
backed by schema-free `data` slots shaped `{labels: [...], series:
[{name, values}]}`) and `sample_files` (real example content, paths
relative to the template dir). Generate content that matches this schema
— either Markdown with YAML frontmatter (one key per slot except `body`,
which is the markdown after the closing `---`) or a flat JSON/YAML object
keyed by slot name — then hand it to `jimemo render`.

## Guarantees

- **Self-contained output.** A rendered `out.html` inlines its CSS and
  images and fetches nothing at view time; open it directly in a
  browser or hand it to someone with no server involved. `jimemo check`
  rejects any `<` inside a `<title>` or `<textarea>` nested in
  `<svg>`/`<math>` (jimemo#cg2h): `html.parser` reads that content as
  text while a browser reads it as markup, so it fails closed rather
  than trust what it cannot see.
- **No network at render time.** Plain `jimemo render` never shells out
  or hits the network. The exceptions: `jimemo publish` (and
  `import-design`'s use of local files) touch the network; the explicit
  PDF modes (`--pdf`, `-o *.pdf`, `jimemo pdf`) shell out to launch the
  locally installed browser -- and nothing else.
- **Sanitized input.** Markdown-typed slot content is rendered through a
  stdlib allowlist sanitizer before it reaches the page.

## The draft loop

A rendered page is an ordinary HTML file: tweak it directly (or edit the
content file and re-render — that overwrites hand-tweaks), then finish:

```
jimemo render auto brief.md -o draft.html --open
jimemo check draft.html          # verify self-containment mid-iteration
jimemo pdf draft.html            # -> draft.pdf (verifies first)
jimemo publish draft.html        # verifies, then posts the unlisted URL
```

`pdf` and `publish` re-run the same self-containment check on HTML input
and refuse on violations; `--no-verify` skips it. PDF conversion runs a
local headless Chromium-family browser because charts are Chart.js —
JavaScript a PDF library cannot execute.

Diagrams ride this loop: markdown slots are sanitized, so inline SVG
can't come in through content. Leave `[[DIAGRAM:NAME]]` placeholder
paragraphs in the content, splice theme-token-colored SVG `<figure>`s
into the rendered HTML, and re-`check`. Patterns and copy-paste snippets:
`docs/diagrams.md`.

## Design systems are bring-your-own

`import-design` reads tokens and font references from a folder (a
Claude-design export) as data — it never opens, imports, or executes any
code in that folder. jimemo ships **zero** design systems: they're
copyrighted brand material, not tool code. Point `import-design` at
whatever export directory the user provides. A reasonable personal
convention is a private repo of exports cloned to
`~/.jimemo/design-systems/`, but that repo is never assumed to exist and
is never fetched automatically. `import-design --from NAME` is sugar for
that convention: it resolves `NAME` (validated as a plain slug) against
`~/.jimemo/design-systems/NAME/` and errors out, naming the expected
path, if nothing's cloned there yet.

## Agent skill

`skill/SKILL.md` is the task-oriented workflow (pick a template, get its
schema, generate content, render, optionally publish/theme) for an agent
driving jimemo end to end. This file is the reference; that one is the
walkthrough.

## Landing changes: main is repoman-managed

This repo carries a `.repoman-managed` marker at its root (and the older
`.marshal-managed`, kept until 2026-09-28), which means one integrator
("repoman", formerly the merge marshal) is the only actor that pushes to `main`. Do not
merge to `main` and do not push to it. Finish your branch, push it, and hand
it off:

```
repoman-submit -r jimemo -p jimemo -t "what the branch does"
```

Repoman rebases the branch onto current `main`, runs `python3 -m pytest
tests -q` in a throwaway checkout with a credential-free environment, and
pushes only if the tests pass. If they fail, the kata issue comes back to you
with a scrubbed failure comment; fix it, push again, and re-run
`repoman-submit` — re-submission is the retry.

`repoman-submit` lives in the cell-fleet repo at
`ops/repoman/bin/repoman-submit` (the old `ops/marshal/bin/marshal-submit`
path works until 2026-09-28). The marker file is the check: if neither
`.repoman-managed` nor `.marshal-managed` is present at a repo's root, that
repo is unmanaged and normal merging applies.
