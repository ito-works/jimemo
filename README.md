# jimemo

Toolkit for making self-contained single-file HTML pages — briefings, memos,
catalogs, timelines, dashboards — from a library of templates, with an
optional private-link publishing setup. Stdlib + vendored dependencies only;
nothing to `pip install`, no network access at render time.

Module map and layout: `docs/architecture.md`. Setting this up for
someone else? See [`docs/friends.md`](docs/friends.md) for the exact
steps.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/ito-works/jimemo.git jimemo
cd jimemo
./install.sh
jimemo doctor
```

Requires Python >= 3.13.6 -- a final release, not a pre-release -- and
nothing else: stdlib plus vendored dependencies only, nothing to
`pip install`. A stock Mac's
`/usr/bin/python3` is 3.9.6, which is below the floor: install a current
Python (macOS: `brew install python@3.13`; Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install
python3.13`) and either put its `python3` first on `PATH` or point
`install.sh` at it with `--python` (below). The floor is 3.13.6
rather than 3.9 because `jimemo check`'s self-containment scan has to read
a page's HTML as closely as possible to the way a browser reads it, and
`html.parser` only stopped disagreeing with a browser about attribute
character references, attribute splitting and unclosed `<style>` elements
in 3.13.4/3.13.6 (`jimemo.PYTHON_FLOOR` records the measurement). Those
are the specific disagreements jimemo hit, not a guarantee that the two
parsers agree in general — `src/jimemo/_parser_floor.py` lists a known
remaining divergence. `./jimemo` run from the checkout checks the
interpreter it was run with and refuses below the floor with one line; it
never searches `PATH`. To run it with a specific interpreter, invoke it
directly: `python3.13 /path/to/jimemo render ...`.

`install.sh` binds the installed `jimemo` to one interpreter, chosen when
you run it. It tries `python3`, `python3.13` and `python3.14` in that
order and takes the first that qualifies -- verified by running it, since
a name says nothing about whether `python3.13` is 3.13.3 or 3.13.6 -- and
prints which one it bound and why it rejected the ones it tried before
it. To choose
yourself: `./install.sh --python /path/to/python3.13` (or `--python=PATH`),
or `JIMEMO_PYTHON=/path/to/python3.13 ./install.sh`. The flag wins over
the variable; with either, only that interpreter is tried and the install
refuses if it does not qualify. The bound path is the interpreter's own
`sys.executable`, so a version-manager shim binds the interpreter it
currently selects rather than the shim.

It's one clone: `install.sh` writes `~/.local/bin/jimemo` as a small
shell script (the entry point) that runs the bound interpreter by absolute
path against this clone's launcher, and symlinks the skill back to the
clone, so `git pull` updates every harness at once and the installed
`jimemo` no longer depends on which `python3` the calling shell finds. If
that interpreter is later removed or replaced by one below the floor,
`jimemo` prints one line saying so and telling you to re-run
`./install.sh`, which binds another; it never falls back to a different
interpreter. `jimemo doctor` reports the entry point and the interpreter
and version it is bound to. The script is idempotent, replaces an older
symlink-style install, refuses to clobber a file or directory it did not
write, and `./install.sh --uninstall` removes exactly what it created --
the entry point (recognised by its marker line, and only when it was
written from this clone) and the skill symlinks -- leaving the clone
untouched. `--dry-run` prints the plan without writing anything.

`install.sh` creates:

- `~/.local/bin/jimemo`, the entry point: a shell script bound to the
  interpreter chosen above (add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH` if it isn't
  already).
- the agent skill (`skill/`) symlinked into each harness skills directory
  that applies (see the table).

### Per-harness coverage

| Harness | How it gets jimemo | Set up by `install.sh`? |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | skill at `~/.claude/skills/jimemo` | yes |
| **pi** | reads `~/.claude/skills` (its `settings.json` `skills` paths), so it picks up the same skill | yes -- no separate step |
| **Codex** | skill at `~/.codex/skills/jimemo` | yes |
| **Amplifier** | skill at `~/.amplifier/skills/jimemo` | yes |
| **Claude Desktop** (Cowork / local-agent mode) | **skill is not auto-loaded** -- its skills are app-managed, not read from `~/.claude/skills`. But local-agent mode runs shell commands, so the **`jimemo` CLI works** there directly. | CLI only |

**Claude Desktop note:** because Cowork can't load a filesystem skill,
just tell it to use the `jimemo` command (it's on `PATH`), or point it at
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), which is the same CLI contract the skill wraps.
jimemo is CLI-first by design -- the skill is a convenience layer, so any
agent that can run a shell can drive the tool without it.

### Manual install

Without `install.sh`, the CLI is just a symlink, and the skill is a
symlink per harness:

```
ln -s /path/to/jimemo/jimemo   ~/.local/bin/jimemo
ln -s /path/to/jimemo/skill    ~/.claude/skills/jimemo    # Claude Code (and pi)
ln -s /path/to/jimemo/skill    ~/.codex/skills/jimemo     # Codex
ln -s /path/to/jimemo/skill    ~/.amplifier/skills/jimemo # Amplifier
```

The CLI symlink binds no interpreter: it runs whatever `python3` the
calling shell resolves, so that `python3` has to meet the floor.

## Usage

Eight seed templates ship in `templates/`: `briefing`, `chart-dashboard`,
`data-dashboard`, `genealogy`, `ops-board`, `photo-catalog`,
`research-bible`, `timeline`.

List what's available:

```
$ jimemo list
briefing	/path/to/jimemo/templates/briefing
chart-dashboard	/path/to/jimemo/templates/chart-dashboard
data-dashboard	/path/to/jimemo/templates/data-dashboard
genealogy	/path/to/jimemo/templates/genealogy
ops-board	/path/to/jimemo/templates/ops-board
photo-catalog	/path/to/jimemo/templates/photo-catalog
research-bible	/path/to/jimemo/templates/research-bible
timeline	/path/to/jimemo/templates/timeline
```

Start a content file without reverse-engineering the sample — `scaffold`
emits a fill-in skeleton matching a template's slots (markdown frontmatter,
or YAML for templates without a body slot):

```
$ jimemo scaffold briefing -o mynote.md
$ jimemo scaffold ops-board -o board.yaml
```

Inspect a template's slots and suitability:

```
$ jimemo info briefing
briefing — Briefing / memo
A status memo: masthead, prose summary, optional sections.

Slots:
  title            text      required
  date             text
  kicker           text
  subtitle         text
  body             markdown  required
  sections         data
...
```

`--json` gives the same data machine-readable (manifest verbatim plus
`template_dir` and `sample_files`):

```
$ jimemo info briefing --json | python3 -m json.tool
```

Not sure which template fits your content? `suggest` scores every
installed template against a content file and explains why:

```
$ jimemo suggest templates/briefing/sample/content.md
1. briefing  (score 4.0)
     - prose-dominant (212 words, 5 records) -> narrative
     - keyword 'briefing' matched
     - keyword 'status' matched
2. chart-dashboard  (score 3.0)
     - top-level list of records -> tabular-data
3. data-dashboard  (score 3.0)
     - top-level list of records -> tabular-data
```

Render a specific template, or let `auto` pick one via the same scorer:

```
$ jimemo render briefing templates/briefing/sample/content.md -o out.html
wrote out.html

$ jimemo render auto templates/briefing/sample/content.md -o out.html
auto-selected briefing: prose-dominant (212 words, 5 records) -> narrative
wrote out.html
```

A content file is either `.md` (YAML frontmatter for every slot except
`body`, which is the markdown after the closing `---`) or a
`.json`/`.yaml`/`.yml` object keyed by slot name — see any
`templates/<name>/sample/` for a real example. `out.html` is a single file: CSS and images inlined, nothing
fetched at view time; open it directly in a browser.

Add `--pdf [PATH]` to also write a PDF (default: the HTML path with
`.pdf` swapped in), or give `-o` a `.pdf` extension instead for PDF
only — no HTML file gets written. Both need a locally installed
Chromium-family browser; see "The draft loop" below.

By default the page follows the viewer's OS light/dark preference on
screen; `--theme light` or `--theme dark` pins one mode instead. Print
and PDF always use the light palette regardless (the toolkit's
print-force stylesheet), so pinning is about how the page reads in a
browser, not about the PDF. Any other `--theme NAME` applies a named
theme override (see "Import a design" below).

### Research documents

The `research-bible` template renders the output of a retrieval-first
research pipeline — [deeper-research](https://github.com/nraford7/deeper-research)
is the shape it was built against — as one navigable page: a
corpus-provenance line, an evidence-tag legend, a numbered contents
block, one anchored section per research position, an unresolved-links
notice, and a bibliography.

**deeper-research exports through this template automatically.** With
jimemo on `PATH`, its `scripts/export.py` detects the install, checks
the template with `jimemo info research-bible --json`, assembles the
content file itself, and calls `jimemo render` — the HTML Bible lands
next to the run's other export artifacts with no manual assembly (see
[nraford7/deeper-research#3](https://github.com/nraford7/deeper-research/issues/3)).
Without jimemo installed, it falls back to a bundled renderer that
borrows this template's formatting.

The manual mapping below is the reference for wiring any *other*
research pipeline onto the template:

- Each file in the run's `sections/` except `bibliography.md` becomes
  one `sections:` item — `heading` from the file's title line, `body`
  from the markdown below it (drop the title line from the body; the
  template renders the heading itself).
- `sections/bibliography.md` becomes the `bibliography:` slot, its own
  title line dropped the same way.
- The `## ⚠ Unresolved links` block, if the verifier emitted one,
  becomes the `unresolved:` slot.
- Corpus stats from the Bible's provenance line (sources, slices,
  evidence gate, adversary) become the `provenance:` line, and the
  "how to read the evidence tags" legend becomes `legend:` rows.
- The document's title, subtitle, and compilation date fill `title:`,
  `subtitle:`, and `date:`; `kicker:` is the small label above the
  title (the sample uses "Research Bible"); introductory prose before
  the first section becomes the markdown body; and `colophon:` is a
  one-line production note rendered in the page footer.
- Convert `<!-- editorial:background -->` … `<!-- /editorial -->` fences
  to blockquotes with a bold **Background.** lead — the sanitizer strips
  HTML comments, and inside a research section the template styles
  blockquotes as background asides, keeping orienting context visually
  fenced off from corpus findings. The tradeoff: every blockquote in a
  research section gets the aside treatment, so keep verbatim source
  quotations inline (quotation marks) rather than in blockquote form.

The sample (`templates/research-bible/sample/content.md`) fills every
slot: its prose and citations are adapted from a real deeper-research
run's Bible, while the unresolved-links block is invented for
illustration (that run's verification left nothing unresolved).

### The draft loop

`out.html` is an ordinary file: open it, tweak it directly, or edit the
content file and re-render (re-rendering overwrites hand tweaks).
Before finishing, re-verify a hand-tweaked file, convert it, and
publish it:

```
$ jimemo check out.html
ok out.html

$ jimemo pdf out.html
wrote out.pdf

$ jimemo publish out.html
https://notes.example.com/3f9a1c.../
```

`check` re-runs the self-containment lint with no template involved.
`pdf` and `publish` run the same check on HTML input first and refuse
on violations (`--no-verify` skips it); `pdf` then converts through a
locally installed Chromium-family browser (Chrome, Chromium, Edge, or
Brave) since charts are Chart.js — JavaScript a PDF library can't run.
`jimemo doctor` reports whether one was found. See "Publish" below for
backend setup.

### Diagrams

Templates carry charts, not free-form diagrams — and markdown content
is sanitized, so inline SVG can't ride in through a content file.
Diagrams enter through the draft loop instead: leave a
`[[DIAGRAM:NAME]]` placeholder paragraph in the content, render,
replace the placeholder `<p>` in `out.html` with a `<figure>` of
hand-written inline SVG colored with the page's `--jm-*` tokens (so
light/dark mode keeps working), and re-run `jimemo check`. Patterns,
pitfalls, and copy-paste snippets: [`docs/diagrams.md`](docs/diagrams.md).

### Charts

`chart-dashboard` renders a line and a bar
chart from tabular content:

```
$ jimemo render chart-dashboard templates/chart-dashboard/sample/content.yaml -o out.html
wrote out.html
```

A template declares charts in its manifest (`charts: [{id, type,
data_slot, title}]`); each chart reads its data from an ordinary
schema-free `data` slot shaped `{labels: [...], series: [{name,
values}]}` — no chart-specific content format to learn. Chart.js is
vendored under `charts/vendor/chartjs/` and inlined into the page
(no CDN, no network access at view time), so a chart-bearing `out.html`
stays exactly what every other jimemo page is: one self-contained
file you can open directly in a browser.

#### Reading without scripts

A chart is drawn by JavaScript, so a reader that turns scripts off —
a browser setting, a sandboxed frame, or a `script-src 'none'` content
security policy — would otherwise show an empty box. Since jimemo 0.0.4
each chart is written static-first: the page as saved carries every
label, series name and value in an open "Chart data" table under the
chart's title, with the empty canvas hidden. When scripts do run, the
chart's init script draws the chart and folds the table into a
one-line "Chart data" disclosure the reader can open. Units belong in
the series name or the chart title (`MRR ($k)`); the table shows them
as written.

- **Detecting it:** a page with the fallback has one
  `<details class="jm-chart-data">` per chart. `jimemo --version`
  reports 0.0.4 or later.
- **Templates:** `chart-dashboard` passes its data. A personal template
  gets the fallback by calling `ui.chart(c.id, c.init_js, data=c.data,
  title=c.title)`; the two-argument call still renders the bare canvas.
  List `data-table` in the manifest's `components` too for the table's
  full styling (chart-block alone keeps it scrollable but unstyled).
- **Older pages are not upgraded.** A page rendered before 0.0.4 is
  still valid (`jimemo check`, `publish` and `pdf` accept it) but its
  charts exist only as canvas drawings: with scripts off it shows empty
  chart areas. Nothing converts existing files. To get a readable copy,
  re-render it from its content file with the current jimemo, or make a
  static copy with `jimemo pdf page.html`, which draws the charts in a
  local browser and needs no scripts to read.

Scaffold a new personal template under `~/.jimemo/templates/` (discovered
alongside the repo's own):

```
$ jimemo new-template zine
created /Users/you/.jimemo/templates/zine
```

Check the environment (Python version, the installed entry point and the
interpreter it is bound to, vendor checksums, stale suitability labels,
PDF browser availability):

```
$ jimemo doctor
ok   python 3.14.6
ok   entry point /Users/you/.local/bin/jimemo -> /usr/local/bin/python3.14 (3.14.6)
ok   vendor checksums (/path/to/jimemo/vendor)
ok   charts vendored (chart.js 4.5.1)
ok   vendored imports (jinja2, markdown, yaml)
ok   markdown render path (tables, fenced_code)
ok   suitability labels fresh (or none recorded)
ok   pdf browser (/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome)
```

## Import a design

`jimemo import-design <export-dir> --name mybrand` reads a Claude-design
export (a folder of design tokens and fonts produced by the
design-system Skill) and produces a jimemo **theme**: a `--jm-*` token
override file that `jimemo render <template> <content> --theme mybrand`
layers on top of the toolkit's defaults.

```
$ jimemo import-design "Northwind Field Kit" --name mybrand
/* jimemo theme 'mybrand' -- auto-generated from a Claude-design export
 * (namespace: NorthwindFieldKit_7b3f21). Deterministic: re-running the import on the
 * same export regenerates this file byte-for-byte.
 *
 * Auto-mapped roles (source token -> role):
 *   --nw-font -> --jm-font-prose
 *   --nw-font -> --jm-font-ui
 *   --nw-blue-core -> --jm-accent
 *   ...
 */

fonts are referenced by family name only (no font files embedded); they
render correctly only where that family is installed on the viewer's
system. Re-run with --embed-fonts to inline the font files instead (see
the licensing note that prints with it).

wrote theme: /Users/you/.jimemo/themes/mybrand.css
use it with: jimemo render <template> <content> --theme mybrand

$ jimemo render briefing templates/briefing/sample/content.md \
    -o out.html --theme mybrand
```

It's **parse-only**: the importer reads the export's `_ds_manifest.json`
(or, absent a manifest, `tokens/*.css`) and never opens, imports, or
executes the export's `.js`/`.jsx`/`.ts` files — the whole export is
treated as untrusted data, never as code. Every token value is
validated before it lands in the generated theme (rejecting anything
that could break out of a CSS declaration or point at a remote
resource), and the theme itself is checked against the same
self-contained-page rule every other jimemo output follows: no remote
`url()`, no remote `image-set()` / `-webkit-image-set()` candidate (a bare
string there fetches exactly like a `url()`), no `@import`, no script.

Fonts map to family name + a generic fallback stack by default, so the
theme names the brand's typeface but renders correctly only where that
font is already installed on the viewer's machine. Pass `--embed-fonts`
to instead read the export's font files and inline them into the theme
as base64 `data:` URIs — the rendered page stays self-contained but
gets larger, and only makes sense for fonts you're licensed to
redistribute, since embedding publishes the font bytes in every page
rendered with that theme.

`--embed-fonts` embeds only the faces the generated theme uses, not
every file the export ships: a face is embedded when the theme's CSS
names its family in a font stack (any position: a browser falls back
per character, so a second family supplies the glyphs the first lacks)
and states its weight and style,
and a theme that states no weight (every generated theme today) gets the
regular face — weight 400, style normal — of each family it names. A
family the export ships without that exact face (a display family in
Bold only) gets the nearest weight of the same style, as a browser
would choose it. An
export with a dozen weights therefore adds one or two faces to the theme
instead of all twelve; bold and italic text on the page is then
synthesized by the browser. The import summary lists every skipped face
as family / weight / style, so a weight you wanted is visibly dropped
and not silently missing, and the embed step never opens a skipped
face's file.

Imported themes are written to `~/.jimemo/themes/<name>.css`, never
into the repo, and take precedence over a repo theme of the same
name — a theme you just imported wins even on a name collision.

### Design systems are bring-your-own

jimemo ships **zero** design systems: they're copyrighted brand
material (colors, typefaces, logos), not tool code, so none are
bundled with this repo, ever. Point `import-design` at an export
directory someone gave you, or keep a personal collection in a
private repo you control, cloned to `~/.jimemo/design-systems/`:

> **Respect the copyright.** A design system you import belongs to its
> owner — only use ones you have the rights to, don't redistribute them,
> and don't publish pages that embed their fonts (`--embed-fonts`) unless
> you're licensed to. jimemo is the tool; the brand material is not yours
> to hand on.

```
git clone <your-private-design-systems-repo> ~/.jimemo/design-systems
jimemo import-design --from mybrand    # resolves ~/.jimemo/design-systems/mybrand/
```

`--from <name>` is sugar for the positional export-dir argument — it
resolves `<name>` (a lowercase-letters/digits/hyphens slug; nothing
else, since it becomes a path component) against that convention dir
and errors out, naming the exact path it expected, if nothing's there
yet. It's mutually exclusive with passing an export dir positionally;
the positional form still works unchanged for a one-off export
that isn't part of a collection.

## Publish

`jimemo publish` turns a rendered `out.html` into an unlisted private
link, mirroring notes.ito.com's model: a 24-hex-char hash path is the
access control (`secrets.token_hex(12)`, ~96 bits, unguessable), reading
and purging use the same URL, and purging tombstones a hash rather than
deleting it outright. Configure exactly one backend in
`~/.jimemo/config.toml`. The same file takes an optional `[pdf] browser`
key naming a specific Chromium-family binary, for when `jimemo pdf` /
`--pdf` can't auto-detect one already on the machine.

### `command` backend — you already run a publish site

If you already run something like `notes-publish` (notes.ito.com's own
CLI), point jimemo at it instead of reimplementing hosting:

```toml
[publish]
backend = "command"
command = "notes-publish"
```

```
$ jimemo render briefing content.md -o out.html
$ jimemo publish out.html
https://notes.example.com/3f9a1c.../

$ jimemo publish purge https://notes.example.com/3f9a1c.../
```

jimemo shells out to `command` for publish/purge/list/gc and parses the
published URL from its stdout; the configured command stays the sole
authority on hosting, hashing, and storage.

### `cloudflare` backend — no existing site

For someone with nowhere to publish to yet: `jimemo publish setup` walks
through provisioning a free Cloudflare Pages project and KV namespace.
It needs Node (wrangler runs through `npx wrangler`), curl >= 8.3 (one
project-config call per deploy that wrangler cannot make: it confirms the
Pages project is fail-closed, so a Functions outage never serves purged
pages), and a Cloudflare API token scoped to `Pages: Edit` + `Workers KV
Storage: Edit`, exported as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`; a couple
of one-time steps (creating the KV namespace, binding it to the Pages
project as `TOMBSTONES`) have no wrangler CLI equivalent, so the wizard
prints the exact manual command or dashboard step instead of faking
automation of it. See [`docs/publish-setup.md`](docs/publish-setup.md)
for the full walkthrough — including publishing from several machines,
where making the state directory a git repo turns on automatic
syncing — dirty-tree refusal, pull, then commit + push before every
deploy (the same model notes.ito.com uses); `--no-sync` skips it for
one deploy. Preview the whole plan without touching any account:

```
$ jimemo publish setup --dry-run
```

Once configured, publish/purge/list/gc use the same commands shown
above for the `command` backend.

### Security model

The hash is the entire access-control story: unguessable, and symmetric
between read and purge — anyone with the link can view or purge it,
nobody without the link can find it. Purging tombstones the hash
(subsequent requests 404) rather than deleting the underlying file;
`gc` is the separate step that removes tombstoned files. Full details,
including multi-machine publishing via a git-synced state directory,
are in [`docs/publish-setup.md`](docs/publish-setup.md).

## Security posture

- **Self-contained output.** A rendered `out.html` inlines its CSS and
  images; nothing is fetched when it's opened. Hand it to anyone with
  no server involved. `jimemo check` rejects any `<` inside a `<title>`
  or `<textarea>` in or after an `<svg>`/`<math>` (jimemo#cg2h): Python's
  `html.parser` reads that content as text while a browser reads it as
  markup, so the check fails closed rather than trust what it cannot see.
- **No network at view or render time.** `jimemo render` never shells
  out or touches the network. `jimemo publish` is the only subcommand
  that does (and only when you run it).
- **Sanitized content.** Markdown-typed slot content goes through a
  stdlib allowlist sanitizer before it lands in the page.
- **Design exports are untrusted data.** `import-design` reads an
  export's tokens and font references; it never opens, imports, or
  executes any code the export directory contains.
- **Vendored, checksummed dependencies.** Jinja2, MarkupSafe, Markdown,
  PyYAML, and Chart.js are vendored into the repo, not fetched
  at install or run time; `jimemo doctor` verifies them against
  checked-in SHA-256 sums and refuses to import a tampered copy.

### Contributing

Open an ordinary GitHub pull request. `main` only takes writes from an
automated merge queue on Joi's side, so a maintainer lands your branch
for you after review — the PR itself is all you need to do. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Landing changes: `main` is repoman-managed (maintainers)

This repo's `main` has one writer — repoman, formerly the merge-marshal (see
`.repoman-managed`; the old `.marshal-managed` marker stays until 2026-09-28). Finished work is pushed as a branch and handed off:

```
git push -u origin <branch>
<cell-fleet>/ops/repoman/bin/repoman-submit -r jimemo -p jimemo [-i <kata-ref>]
```

A GitHub repository ruleset enforces this. Direct pushes and web-UI PR
merges to `main` are rejected with GH013; the only identity that bypasses
the ruleset is repoman's own push credential. Retarget finished PR branches
through `repoman-submit`. The ruleset's identifiers, repoman's credential
and the break-glass procedure are operator detail and live in the private
runbook, not in this repo.
