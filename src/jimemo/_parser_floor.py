"""Refuse to provide jimemo's HTML checks on an unsupported interpreter.

jimemo#y9p8 carried a fail-closed guard inside the linter because
``html.parser`` before CPython 3.13.4 decodes a semicolonless character
reference inside an attribute where a browser keeps it literal, which moves
CSS string boundaries and can hide a live ``url()`` behind an apparent
comment. Joi ruled (jimemo#gaga) that the floor rises instead, so the guard
is gone, and this module is the boundary that replaces it.

It checks two things: the interpreter is at or above ``jimemo.PYTHON_FLOOR``,
and it is a FINAL release. The second is not pedantry -- CPython 3.14.0b1
compares ``(3, 14, 0) >= (3, 13, 6)`` and so passed every boundary in an
earlier draft, while its ``html.parser`` fails all three disagreements below
and jimemo#y9p8's payload lints clean on it (measured on the real build;
gh-69426 landed in 3.14.0b2). A version number cannot say which pre-release
carries which backport.

**Why only a version check.** An earlier draft of this module also MEASURED
the running parser -- feeding it probe inputs and refusing if any answer
disagreed with a browser -- so that a distribution which backported one of
these fixes into an older release, or shipped a current release with one
reverted, would be seen for what it is. Two independent reviews then found
the probe set incomplete, each time for a different clause of CPython's
implementation (the semicolonless-name rule alone has three), and the second
demonstrated a live lint bypass on a parser that passed every probe.

That is the trap Joi's ruling already rejected as option 2: a complete probe
set is a model of ``html.parser``, and a model of a tokenizer is the thing
that keeps disagreeing with the tokenizer. So the probes are gone. The
version number is the contract, and the SUITE is the detector -- the 318-case
canary and the nine jimemo#y9p8 payload vectors in ``tests/test_lint.py``
fail loudly on any interpreter whose parser does not behave, which is what
the ruling asked for: delete the guard only where a test proves the floor
matches the browser rule for that input.

The residual risk is stated plainly rather than half-guarded. A release at or
above the floor with one of these fixes reverted is accepted here, and only
running the suite would reveal it. A backport into an older release is
refused even though its parser may be fine. Both follow from supporting a
version range instead of modelling a parser.

**Why this module exists at all**, rather than just the launcher's check:
``install.sh``, the ``./jimemo`` launcher and ``jimemo doctor`` all check the
version, but a direct caller -- ``from jimemo.lint import lint_html``, which
is how y9p8's own reproduction is written -- passes none of the three. This
is the boundary that caller crosses.

**Scope of the contract, stated exactly.** ``jimemo/__init__.py`` holds
``PYTHON_FLOOR`` and deliberately does NOT check it: ``jimemo doctor`` must
stay importable on a sub-floor interpreter so it can *report* the problem
(one line, non-zero exit) instead of dying in a traceback, which is what
jimemo#gaga asks of it.

  ``./jimemo``      refuses every command, one line on stderr, exit 1
  ``install.sh``    refuses to install; ``--uninstall`` still works
  ``jimemo doctor`` reports the running version and fails below the floor
  this module       raises at import of ``jimemo.lint`` and ``jimemo.sanitize``

``jimemo.sanitize`` parses HTML too and has the same dependence; it calls
the same check at import (jimemo#dexg). ``jimemo doctor`` reaches it through
``jimemo.content`` inside its own try/except, so below the floor doctor
prints one more FAIL line rather than a traceback.

**What the floor does NOT fix.** It is the three specific disagreements that
jimemo#y9p8, jimemo#86jn and jimemo#1gs5 ran into -- semicolonless attribute
references (gh-69426, 3.13.4), unclosed ``<style>`` text (gh-86155, 3.13.4),
and ``<div title==""id id=grad>`` attribute splitting (3.13.6, the component
that sets the floor) -- not a claim of general equivalence. At least one
divergence is known to REMAIN on every supported interpreter:

  foreign-content RCDATA -- CPython treats ``title`` and ``textarea`` as
  RCDATA regardless of namespace, so inside ``<svg>`` or ``<math>`` it hands
  their content over as TEXT. A browser only does that in the HTML namespace;
  in foreign content the same bytes are real markup. So
  ``<svg><title><style>a{background:url(https://host/x)}</style></title></svg>``
  is markup a browser parses and fetches from, while this parser reports a
  text node and jimemo's self-containment scan never sees it. Confirmed
  against Chromium. NOT a consequence of retiring the y9p8 guard (it is live
  on any 3.13.4+, including every current fleet Mac) and NOT fixed here:
  lint compensates instead (jimemo#cg2h) -- any ``<`` in the data of a
  ``title``/``textarea`` in or after an ``<svg>``/``<math>`` is an error, an escaped
  ``&lt;`` included, so the divergence fails closed.
