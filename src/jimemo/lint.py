"""Static checks on rendered HTML output.

Errors block writing the output file; warnings are advisory (printed to
stderr by the render pipeline, output still written).

Checks run at structural positions only — real tags and attributes found
by parsing the document (stdlib html.parser, same approach as
sanitize.py) — never on escaped text. Prose like "phase one = done" or
"never use javascript: URLs" is inert once escaped and must not block a
render; only an actual event-handler attribute, script tag, or
disallowed URL in a live attribute counts. These are last-gate tripwires
on the assembled page: the markdown sanitizer (sanitize.py) should make
them unreachable for slot content; they exist so template-authored
markup and text/data-slot values written straight into a macro's
attribute (which bypass markdown sanitization entirely) fail closed too.

The core rule is a strict ALLOWLIST over every attribute the browser
fetches at page-load time (_FETCH_ON_LOAD_ATTRS). A resource reference
there is legal in exactly one form: an inlined raster
``data:image/{png,jpeg,jpg,gif,webp}`` URI, and only on an attribute
that displays an image (_IMAGE_DATA_URI_ATTRS — what inline_images
produces).

Everything else is an error, INCLUDING a pure ``#fragment``: a
fetch-on-load attribute still makes the browser attempt a
same-document resource load for a fragment value — unlike ``<a
href="#section">``, which only navigates within the page on click and
is not in _FETCH_ON_LOAD_ATTRS at all. jimemo pages never legitimately
put a fragment in a resource-load attribute, so it fails closed here
too. Also an error: remote http(s), protocol-relative
``//host/...``, any other scheme, non-raster or non-image ``data:``
payloads, ``data:`` anywhere outside an image attribute, empty values,
and surviving bare local paths — a local path that reached the final
HTML means a sidecar-file dependency inline_images could not localize,
so the output is not self-contained. Enumerating bad forms is a losing
game; anything not explicitly allowed fails closed.

Two further gates sit in front of the attribute allowlist. A set of
tags is banned outright (_BANNED_TAGS): iframe/frame/frameset/object/
embed/applet/portal each embed a nested browsing context or plugin
content — ``<iframe srcdoc>`` executes script with no src attribute at
all, which no per-attribute check can see — and ``<form>`` turns a
static document into a data-exfiltration vector on submit; any
occurrence of these tags is an error, attributes unexamined. And CSS
is scanned: every ``<style>`` element's text and every ``style="..."``
attribute value is searched for ``url(...)`` references,
``image-set()`` bare-string candidates and ``@import`` rules. A
``url()`` target must satisfy the same allowlist
as a fetch-on-load attribute; ``@import`` always loads a stylesheet,
which has no allowed form, so any ``@import`` is an error. Comments
are removed first, but only where a browser would read one: a ``/*``
inside a string or an unquoted ``url(`` token is text, not a comment
(_css_comments_stripped).

A third, narrower gate answers the parser rather than the page.
CPython's html.parser (the 3.13.6 floor) reads ``title`` and
``textarea`` as RCDATA elements regardless of namespace, but a browser
special-cases them only in the HTML namespace: inside ``<svg>`` or
``<math>`` the same bytes are ordinary markup the browser parses,
fetches and runs, while the parser hands them to lint as inert text.
So a ``<`` in the data of a ``<title>``/``<textarea>`` that sits in
foreign content is an error — markup this lint can no longer see. An
escaped ``&lt;`` decodes to ``<`` before the check sees it and is
rejected with it rather than told apart (accepted over-rejection:
jimemo chart titles never need a literal ``<``), and the error says so.
HTML integration points (``<foreignObject>``, MathML ``<mi>``/``<mtext>``),
where a browser is back in the HTML namespace and the title IS text, are
not modelled, so a ``<`` there is rejected too -- over-rejection that
fails closed. Nor is which elements a browser's end tags close (it
ignores ``</svg>`` while an HTML element inside ``<foreignObject>`` is
current), so the rule covers every ``<title>``/``<textarea>`` from the
first ``<svg>``/``<math>`` on, not only those this linter thinks are
still inside one. A ``<noscript>``'s second reading applies the same rule.

Separate from the fetch allowlist, execution checks remain: ``on*``
attributes and ``javascript:``/``vbscript:`` URLs are never allowed
anywhere, ``<script src>`` is never allowed, ``<script>`` requires the
manifest to declare charts, ``<meta http-equiv="refresh">`` (a
navigation at view time) is never allowed, and ``<base href>`` (which
re-roots every relative URL) is never allowed. ``<canvas>`` is not
restricted: without script it is an inert blank box, and the script
rules already gate execution.

On a chart page the inline-script opening is itself an allowlist over
script BODIES, in one of two modes. On the real render path,
render_page passes ``allowed_scripts`` — the EXACT bodies it emitted
(the inlined vendored Chart.js text plus one charts.chart_init_js body
per declared chart) — and lint requires the page's inline scripts to
equal that multiset: a forged or altered body, an extra script, a
duplicate, or a missing one is each an error, so the page carries
exactly the scripts the renderer built and nothing else (surrounding
whitespace is normalized identically on both sides; it cannot arm or
disarm a body). Without ``allowed_scripts`` (direct lint_html callers
with no render context) the check falls back to STRUCTURAL recognition
of the two renderer-emitted byte shapes: the vendored Chart.js bundle
(byte-compared against the file at CHARTJS_BUNDLE, read lazily at lint
time) and, per declared chart, an init in exactly the shape
charts.chart_init_js builds, whose id the manifest declares, whose
config contains no raw ``<`` (the serializer u003c-escapes every one),
and whose config parses as JSON — pure data, never code. The
structural mode cannot tell a hand-forged-but-well-shaped init from
the renderer's own (same id, different config bytes); the exact mode
can, which is why the render pipeline always passes allowed_scripts.
Either way any other inline script is an error, so a shared
third-party template cannot ride a chart declaration to embed its own
JavaScript, and neither mode is a JavaScript judge: each recognizes
renderer output and rejects everything else, fail closed.

In exact mode, five further completeness checks close a gap the body
multiset alone leaves open: a page can contain exactly the renderer's
script bodies and still fail to draw a chart. (1) Every matched script
must be a bare executable ``<script>`` -- no ``type`` attribute, or
``type`` in ``{"text/javascript", "module"}``; a non-executable type
(``application/json``, ``text/template``, ...) is inert data a browser
never runs, so a byte-perfect body wrapped in one would silently draw
nothing. A classic ``<script>`` carrying ``nomodule`` is rejected for
the same reason: every browser that supports modules skips it. (2)
The library body must run before every init body -- ``new Chart(...)``
needs the ``Chart`` global already defined (execution order, which
deferred module scripts make differ from document order; see below). (3) Every manifest-declared chart id must have a
matching ``<canvas id="...">`` somewhere on the page. (4) That canvas
must appear, in document order, before the chart's init script -- an
init that runs first finds no element yet (``getElementById`` returns
null) and draws nothing. An inline ``<script type="module">`` without
``async`` is exempt: a browser runs it only once parsing has finished,
when the whole document is already there. That same deferral means
check 2 compares EXECUTION order, not source order: classic scripts
run where they stand, then the deferred modules in source order, so a
deferred library still loads after every classic init, and a deferred
init runs after a classic library wherever it sits. An ``async``
inline module runs whenever it is ready, so check 2 accepts one only
where it cannot matter -- an async init after a classic library -- and
rejects every other order involving it as indeterminate. (5) The canvas must be the FIRST element
carrying that id; the id showing up earlier on some other element (a
``<div>`` or an ``<img>``, say) does not count -- the init script's
``getElementById`` call would resolve to that element, which Chart.js
cannot draw on. These are not new security boundaries -- the body
allowlist above is the boundary -- they complete the guarantee that an
exact-mode pass means the page actually renders the charts it
declares.

All five checks read the page as a scripting-enabled browser builds its
live DOM, which html.parser does not: it reports every tag it meets as
an element. Two containers hold markup that never reaches that DOM. A
``<template>``'s contents go into a separate DocumentFragment that
``getElementById`` never searches, and whose scripts never run; with
scripting on, a ``<noscript>``'s contents are raw text, not elements,
ending at the first ``</noscript>``. So a canvas or an id inside either
satisfies and triggers none of checks 3-5, and a matched chart script
inside either is an error (it is consumed, so no "missing" error piles
on top): a browser never runs it. A ``<template shadowrootmode>`` is
read as a plain template: its contents are hidden from
``getElementById`` too, and a script there, which a browser does run,
fails closed. The container element itself is read as live, and its
own id counts. Inside
``<svg>`` or ``<math>`` a ``template`` or ``noscript`` is an ordinary
foreign element, and its contents count. Only this bookkeeping skips
those contents; every self-containment and execution rule above still
applies to them.

# --- CSS references -------------------------------------------------------
# CSS fetches on its own: a url(...) in any property (background,
# cursor, @font-face src, ...) and an @import both load their target at
# style-apply time, so <style> element text and style="..." attribute
# values are scanned against their own allowlist: a url() may hold an
# inlined raster data:image URI, an inlined data:font URI (ttf/otf/woff/
# woff2 — a design-theme @font-face's only legitimate src form; see
# jimemo.design.importer's --embed-fonts), or a pure #fragment (a
# same-document paint-server reference, e.g. fill:url(#grad), which
# never fetches), nothing else. This is broader than the HTML
# fetch-on-load attribute allowlist above, which no longer accepts a
# fragment at all — a CSS
# url() fragment is a reference to an element in the current document,
# not a resource-load attribute pointing at an external resource, so
# the two are judged differently on purpose. @import's target is a
# stylesheet — no allowed form exists (a raster image or a fragment is
# never a stylesheet) — so any @import is an error outright. Violations are
# searched for in the comment-stripped text AND in a copy with CSS
# escapes decoded, so `\75rl(x)` and `@\69mport` cannot hide (a comment
# between a name and its `(`, as in `url/**/(x)`, leaves a space and
# makes no function, for the scan as for a browser); the decoded copy only ever ADDS findings (allowances are judged
# on the extracted URL text itself), so over-decoding cannot bless an
# unsafe value — it can only over-reject, which fails closed.
# image-set()/-webkit-image-set() take a BARE STRING candidate
# (image-set("https://..." 1x)) that fetches on load without ever

    the parentheses — bare, or inside one pair of matching quotes with
    nothing but whitespace around them — with surrounding whitespace
    removed; None for a construct that does not read (no closing ``)``,
    a quote after bare target text, or something other than whitespace
    and ``)`` after the closing quote).

    Reads exactly the language of the regex it replaced,
    ``url\\(\\s*(?:"([^"]*)"|'([^']*)'|([^)"']*))\\s*\\)``, but in one
    forward pass. In that pattern the leading ``\\s*``, the bare-target
    class and the trailing ``\\s*`` could all absorb the same
    whitespace, so an unterminated ``url(`` followed by n spaces cost
    O(n^3) before failing, and every open re-ran the match over the rest
    of the text (jimemo#ay7w). Here each open reads forward to the first
    ``)`` or quote, and that stop is shared: the first stop at or after
    one open is also the first at or after every later open before it,
    so the stop scans together cover the text once. When no stop exists
    ahead, this open and every later one are unterminated, so the
    generator ends after one None (the caller reports the construct once).

    In that default reading, opens nested inside one bare target
    (``url(url(x))``) each yield their own target, as the regex did, so
    n opens sharing one ``)`` hand the caller n overlapping targets to
    copy and check — work proportional to opens x length. With
    `url_tokens`, the reading css_reference_errors uses, a browser's
    reading applies instead (jimemo#j7mv): a bare target is one url
    token, the ``url(`` opens inside it are URL text, and the scan
    resumes after the token's ``)``. The url tokens read are disjoint,
    and each yields its target plus at most one nested target inside it
    (see below), so the targets yielded total at most twice the text's
    length. Only a cleanly matched
    bare target moves the resume point; a quoted target and the three
    None branches keep the character after the open, so an unreadable
    construct can never make the scan skip a later well-formed url(.

    Skipping the nested opens accepts nothing new. A bare target that
    contains an open is judged by itself, and the allowlist accepts it
    only as a #fragment or an allowed data: URI. The per-open reading
    also judged each nested target, all of which end at the same ``)``,
    so when the outer target is accepted the nested opens are still
    walked, without copying their targets. Entering that walk means
    judging the outer target HERE as well (the caller judges it
    again), so the walk is entered only when an open sits inside the
    target, and started at that open: a cleanly matched target with
    no nested open — every real stylesheet's — is judged once, by
    the caller alone (the double judgement cost 25 ms per 500 KB
    inlined data: URI). A nested target that is a
    fragment is accepted there too, which _css_url_fragment_at decides
    from its first characters. The first one that is not is yielded as
    the per-open reading yielded it, and the walk ends, since the text
    is rejected either way. If that target turns out to be an allowed
    data: URI, None follows it: judging every nested data: target in
    full would bring back opens x length, so such a target fails
    closed. No stylesheet puts ``url(`` inside a bare target, where a
    browser reads a bad-url token that loads nothing.

    `text`, in order: the content of every
    quoted string at nesting depth 0 of the construct — the candidate
    form ``image-set("b.png" 1x)`` that fetches on load without ever
    writing ``url(``. None for a construct this scanner cannot read
    (no closing ``)``, a depth-0 candidate string that never closes, or
    a ``/*`` it cannot place — see below), which the caller reports,
    failing closed exactly as it does for ``url(``.

    One forward pass in which every branch advances, after the manner
    of _css_url_targets (jimemo#ay7w): no regex with overlapping
    quantifiers, so no input can spin it. A stack of open ``(``
    records, for each one, whether it opened an image-set; a quoted
    string is a candidate exactly when the TOP of that stack is an
    image-set open, which is what "nesting depth 0 of the image-set"
    means mechanically. That one rule also leaves a ``url("...")``
    candidate to _css_url_targets — which already reads it, so it is
    not yielded twice — and skips a ``type("image/png")`` string, which
    is a format hint, not a resource. A nested image-set inside an
    image-set is scanned the same way (its own strings sit on top of
    the stack). CSS Images 4 forbids that nesting, so a browser drops
    the declaration: reporting it over-rejects, in the safe direction.
    Any other function inside an image-set (``var()``, ``env()``, a
    gradient) yields None: see _CSS_IMAGE_SET_INNER_FUNCTIONS.

    Token boundaries are read the way _css_comments_stripped reads
    them, with the same helpers, because `text` is that function's
    output and any disagreement about where a string or a ``)`` is
    hides a candidate. Each of these returned no finding while a
    browser fetched, before the walk agreed with the stripper
    (jimemo#ktmx):

      * ``.a\\'{} b{background:image-set("https://e.x/p" 1x)} .c\\'{}``
        -- an escaped quote outside a string is part of an ident, not a
        string opener. Scanning the escape-decoded copy does not
        rescue this: decoding turns ``\\'`` into a real quote there.
        So the function name is decoded HERE, from the raw ident run
        (``image-\\73 et(`` is a match in the raw text too).
      * ``image-set(url(#g\\)) 1x, "https://e.x/p" 1x)`` -- an unquoted
        url token ends at the first UNESCAPED ``)``; it is consumed
        whole, so nothing inside it opens, closes or quotes.
      * ``"\\a`` + newline + ``"`` -- a hex escape eats the one
        whitespace after it, so that newline does not end the string.
      * ``foourl(#g)`` and then ``image-set(/*)*/"https://e.x/p" 1x)``
        -- after a name ending in ``url`` the stripper stops stripping
        on purpose, so a real comment can arrive here with a ``)`` in
        it. A ``/*`` outside a string or url token therefore means the
        boundaries after it are not known: the scan ends there, with
        None if an image-set is open or the rest of the text still
        names one (escapes decoded).

    ``#`` or ``@`` + a name is a hash token or at-keyword, so its ``(``
    opens an ordinary block and never a url token -- but it is still
    read as an image-set when the name ends that way
    (_CSS_IMAGE_SET_SUFFIX).
    ``<!--`` is one CDO token, so ``x<!--image-set(`` is a real
    image-set function. A string that runs to EOF unclosed ends the
    scan: a browser reads no token after it either, so there is
    nothing later to miss — at image-set depth 0 it yields None first.

    The comment-split name ``image-/**/set("x" 1x)`` is not reported:
    the stripper leaves a space for the comment, so the name arrives as
    ``image-`` and then ``set(``, the two tokens a browser reads, and a
