    terminal (\UXXXXXXXX for the astral ones, repr()'s spelling of the
    same thing).

    Non-printable is exactly what `str.isprintable()` rejects: the C0/C1
    controls (an ESC or U+009B begins a CSI sequence the terminal will
    run), U+007F, the bidi overrides U+202A-U+202E and U+2066-U+2069
    (which rewrite how every glyph after them renders), and anything
    else Unicode classes as Other or Separator -- with two exceptions,
    newline and tab, the theme header's own multi-line shape. Everything
    printable passes through verbatim, non-ASCII included: unlike the
    `!r` the font-family lines above use, this must not quote or flatten
    the whole string, and a Japanese family name in the header has to
    stay readable."""
