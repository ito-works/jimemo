"""Publish `mujin/review-evidence` as a check run under the App (kata jibot-code#q4av).

Runs on the bridge runner, from main's copy of the workflow, on three triggers
— none of which executes a pull request's YAML:

  pull_request_target   verify ONE pull request head against kata
  workflow_dispatch     the same, asked for by `repoman-submit` on a re-submission
  workflow_run (gate, requested, event merge_group)
                        verify every member of a merge group, then publish the
                        same check on the merge-group commit

It never checks out, imports or executes anything from the pull request. What it
reads from a pull request is text (the body) and identifiers, and both are
validated before they reach an argv. The kata project the body names must be
one the repository declares in KATA_PROJECTS, or the check fails — on the pull
request's head, and again for every member when its merge group is checked:
the group re-runs the pull-request verdict (current body, current variable,
evidence read from kata) for each member, on top of the App check on its head.

The check is a CHECK RUN created with the App's installation token, because the
ruleset binds `mujin/review-evidence` to the App's integration_id: a status or
a check from any other identity does not satisfy it, which is what makes the
gate hold against a pull request that rewrites its own workflows.

Exit status: 0 when a check run was published (success OR failure — a published
failure is this job doing its work); 1 when nothing could be published, which
leaves the required check absent and the pull request unmergeable. Fail closed.

    MEASURED on the canary, 2026-09-21: with the queue's REBASE method the
    group's commits are rebased copies, and `GET /commits/{sha}/pulls` attributes
    them to NO pull request. So membership comes from the merge queue itself:
    every entry names its own group commit, its position and its pull request,
    and a group commit carries its own entry plus every entry ahead of it.

    Two cross-checks, both fail-closed: the group must be in the queue at all,
    and the commits it adds to its base must number exactly what its members'
    pull requests hold — an extra commit belongs to nobody.

    The base of that comparison is the entry's own `baseCommit`, from the SAME
    snapshot as the membership. Comparing against the branch NAME races: if an
    entry ahead lands between the two requests, `main...group` shrinks while
    the expected count does not, and a valid group is failed. NOT YET MEASURED:
    what `baseCommit` is for an entry stacked on another (build concurrency
    above 1). Every repo starts at 1, where a group is one entry on main's tip;
    if a stacked entry's base turns out to be the entry ahead, this count fails
    closed and says so, which is the safe way to find out.

    The count depends on the queue's merge method, read from the branch's
    rules (`queue_merge_method`) — never from anything a pull request
    controls. REBASE adds each member's commits and nothing else. MERGE adds
    them plus one merge commit per member, so it is checked as a chain: from
    the group commit, walking first parents, each merge (last member first)
    has exactly two parents, the second is that member's head, and the walk
    ends exactly at the base. Any other method fails closed.
