"""Structural tests for the workflow files (kata jibot-code#q4av).

Adapted from jibot-ops 8f46f7e (kata jibot-code#bden). This repo's parts are
`HOSTED`, `HostedWorkflows`, `Runners` and `ThisReposGate` (jimemo's gate is
pytest alone on a GitHub-hosted runner, so no warm step, no store and no
isolation check); everything else is the source's, unchanged.

Stdlib only, on purpose: these run as plain python3 from a clean checkout,
with nothing installed beyond pytest, so PyYAML is not available and must
not be assumed. These are
text assertions with explicit patterns rather than a YAML parse — narrower, but
they hold in the environment the gate actually runs in, and a YAML parse would
not have caught any of what they check anyway.

The one that matters most is `SecurityInvariant`: no workflow that mentions
`secrets.` may trigger on `pull_request:` or `merge_group:`, because those two
events run the workflow file FROM THE PULL REQUEST. That is the whole trust
split of this design, and it is here as a test rather than as a paragraph in a
spec because a paragraph cannot fail a gate.

Run: python3 -m unittest discover -s ci/scripts -t ci/scripts
