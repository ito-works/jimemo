# jimemo installer: one clone, wired into every harness on this machine.
# `git pull` in the clone updates every harness that points at it — there
# is exactly one copy of the code and one copy of the skill, never a
# fork-per-harness (see the fresheyes lesson: three unsynced copies of the
# same skill in Claude/Codex/Amplifier drifted out of sync and had to be
# patched three separate times; symlinks avoid that class of bug entirely).
#
# The CLI entry point is NOT a symlink (jimemo#p0nk). A symlink to the
# launcher runs whatever `python3` the CALLING shell resolves -- so the
# interpreter this script verified at install time and the one `jimemo`
# later ran with could differ, and on a machine whose interactive shell
# selects an older python3 the installed command refused in exactly the
# shells it was installed for. Instead this script picks ONE interpreter,
# verifies it by running it, and writes ~/.local/bin/jimemo as a small
# shell script that runs the launcher with that interpreter's absolute
# path. The skill registrations stay symlinks.
#
# Portable to the bash 3.2 shipped on macOS: no associative arrays, no
# `mapfile`, no `${var,,}`, and no `set -u` (bash 3.2 treats a reference
# to an empty array under `set -u` as an unbound-variable error). Works on
# a minimal PATH: dirname, readlink, mkdir, ln, rm, chmod, mv, cat.

Usage: install.sh [--dry-run] [--uninstall] [--python PATH] [--help]

Installs the jimemo CLI as ~/.local/bin/jimemo and registers the jimemo
skill with every agent harness that reads a filesystem skills dir (Claude
Code -- and pi, which reads the same dir; Codex; Amplifier if present).
Claude Desktop / Cowork loads skills app-side, not from disk, so it gets
the CLI only (which works in its local-agent mode). One clone; `git pull`
updates every harness.

The CLI entry point is a small shell script bound to ONE Python
interpreter, chosen here and verified by running it: Python >= 3.13.6, a
final release. It runs that interpreter by absolute path, so the installed
`jimemo` does not depend on which python3 the calling shell finds.
Candidates, tried in order; the first supported one is bound:

    python3  python3.13  python3.14

If that interpreter is later removed or replaced by one below the floor,
`jimemo` says so in one line; re-run ./install.sh to bind another.

  --python PATH   bind this interpreter instead of trying the candidates
                  (or JIMEMO_PYTHON=PATH in the environment; the flag wins).
                  It is verified the same way, and nothing else is tried.
  --dry-run       print every action without doing it
  --uninstall     remove exactly what this script wrote -- the entry point
                  and the skill symlinks; the clone is untouched
