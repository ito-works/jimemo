## Ported code

| Author | URL | What was ported |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Joi Ito / notes-ito-com | (private repo, not published) | `publish/cloudflare/_middleware.js` -- the purge/tombstone Cloudflare Pages middleware (24-hex-hash access control, symmetric read/purge, click-confirm, tombstone-in-KV, Origin/Sec-Fetch-Site cross-site guard) is a generalized port of `functions/_middleware.js` from Joi's own notes.ito.com site, along with the noindex `_headers` asset. Control flow, regex, and security checks are verbatim; the KV binding name (now `env.TOMBSTONES`) and the hardcoded domain in page copy (now read from the request's `url.host`) were changed to generalize it beyond one site. jimemo's port also adds a guard for a missing/misconfigured `TOMBSTONES` binding: it fails CLOSED (returns an error for hash-path requests rather than serving the page as if nothing were purged) because jimemo auto-provisions this binding per friend's account via `jimemo publish setup`, a more error-prone path than a single hand-configured site -- a broken binding must never let a purged page silently come back online. |

## Design inspiration

Ideas below informed jimemo's design but no code was copied from any
source.

| Author | URL | Idea |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dave Liepmann / Edward Tufte project | https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css | Sidenotes and margin notes for report-style documents — footnote-style annotations placed in the page margin next to the referenced text instead of at the page bottom, with a CSS-only toggle for small screens. |
| picocss org | https://github.com/picocss/pico | Zero-class, semantic-HTML-first theming — automatic light/dark themes targeting plain tags (`header`, `main`, `article`) with no authored classes required. |
| pytest-dev | https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-html/blob/master/docs/user_guide.rst | Explicit warnings over silent failure when an asset can't be inlined, rather than quietly leaving a linked file as an external reference in "self-contained" mode. |
| Author of cr0x.net | https://cr0x.net/en/dark-mode-toggle-pattern/ | Three-state (`system`/`light`/`dark`) theme attribute pattern on the document root, reacting to both the attribute and `prefers-color-scheme`, instead of a two-state light/dark toggle. |

## Sample content

| Template | Source |
| --- | --- |
| research-bible | Sample adapted (heavily trimmed) from the goal-elicitation example Bible bundled with [deeper-research](https://github.com/nraford7/deeper-research); the template's slot structure mirrors that pipeline's output. |

## Vendored libraries

Every jimemo dependency is vendored into the repo (`vendor/`,
`charts/vendor/`) rather than fetched at install or run time; `jimemo
doctor` checks each one against a checked-in SHA-256 sum before
importing it. Versions are pinned in the table below.
