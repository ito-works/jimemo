# jimemo

jimemo is a CLI, not a library or an API — every step below is a shell
command. That makes this skill portable across any harness that can run a
subprocess (Claude Code, Codex, Cowork, Amplifier); nothing here depends on
being inside Claude Code specifically.

Requires `jimemo` on `PATH` (see the repo's `install.sh` / README) and
Python >= 3.13.6 — an older interpreter is refused with one line on stderr,
not a weaker check. If it's missing, run `jimemo doctor` after installing to
confirm the environment is sane before doing anything else; doctor's first
line is the interpreter version and it fails below the floor.

## Workflow

### 1. Pick a template

If you already know roughly what the content is, ask `suggest` to rank
templates against it:

```
jimemo suggest <content-file> --json
```

Otherwise browse what's installed:

```
jimemo list
```

Templates live in the repo's `templates/` and in `~/.jimemo/templates/`
(personal templates, discovered alongside the built-in ones). `suggest`
needs a content file already shaped for *some* template's slots; if you
haven't drafted content yet, skip ahead and let `render auto` (below) pick
after you've drafted it against a reasonable guess.

### 2. Get the content schema

Before writing content, get the template's slot contract:

```
jimemo info <template> --json
```

The `slots` object is the contract: each key is a content field, with a
`type` (`text`, `markdown`, or `data`) and whether it's `required`. `data`
slots that back a chart (see `charts` in the same JSON) are schema-free —
shape them `{labels: [...], series: [{name, values}]}`. Read
`sample_files` (paths relative to the template dir) for a real example of
the shape.

### 3. Generate content matching the schema

Start from a skeleton instead of copying the sample:

```
jimemo scaffold <template> -o content.md
```

Every slot appears with an empty value and a required/optional + type
annotation; data slots carry the shape from the manifest or the
template's sample. Fill it in (or write the file from scratch):

Write a content file as either:
- **Markdown** (`.md`): YAML frontmatter with one key per slot, except
  `body` — that slot is everything after the closing `---`.
- **JSON or YAML** (`.json` / `.yaml`): a flat object keyed by slot name.

Only fill slots the manifest declares; required slots must be present.

### 4. Render

```
jimemo render <template> <content-file> -o out.html
```

If you're not fully sure which template fits, use `auto` instead of a
template name — it runs the same scorer as `suggest`, then walks the
ranking and picks the first template whose manifest actually accepts the
content (falling through candidates that need slots the content doesn't
have):

```
jimemo render auto <content-file> -o out.html
```

`render auto` prints which template it picked and why (or which ones it
skipped and why) to stderr — read that if the result looks wrong. The
output is always one self-contained HTML file: CSS and images inlined,
nothing fetched at view time. Nothing further needs bundling to share it.
(`jimemo check` rejects any `<` inside an `<svg>`/`<math>` `<title>` or
`<textarea>`, even an escaped `&lt;`: keep those texts free of `<`.)

### 4b. Iterate locally (draft mode)

The rendered file is the draft: open it, tweak the HTML directly, or
edit the content file and re-render (re-rendering overwrites hand
tweaks). Before finishing, re-verify a hand-tweaked file:

```
jimemo check out.html
```

It re-runs the self-containment lint without needing the template.
`jimemo pdf` and `jimemo publish` run the same check themselves and
refuse on violations (`--no-verify` skips).

### 4c. Diagrams (inline SVG)

Templates have no diagram slot, and markdown slots are sanitized — SVG
written into a content file will not survive rendering. Diagrams go in
with `render --figure`:

1. Leave a placeholder paragraph of its own in the content where each
   diagram belongs: `[[DIAGRAM:NAME]]` (NAME: letters, digits, `_`, `-`).
2. Write each diagram as a standalone file whose root is one `<svg>`.
3. `jimemo render TEMPLATE content.md -o out.html --figure NAME=file.svg`
   (repeat `--figure` per diagram). Each placeholder is replaced with the
   SVG, sanitized, in a `<figure>`; the page is linted after the splice,
   and re-rendering repeats it. A NAME with no placeholder is an error.

The sanitizer is an allowlist: shapes, text, `defs`/gradients/markers/
patterns, geometry and presentation attributes and `style` survive;
`<script>`, `<style>`, `<foreignObject>`, `<image>`, `<a>`, animation,
`on*` attributes and external references do not. A `style` or
presentation-attribute value with a backslash, a `/*` or `*/`, or a
function outside `var(--token)`, `url(#id)`, `rgb()/rgba()/hsl()/hsla()`,
`color-mix()`, `calc()/min()/max()/clamp()` and the 2D transforms
(`translate[XY]`, `scale[XY]`, `rotate`, `skewX`, `skewY`, `matrix`) is
dropped whole, every declaration with it — write `url(#grad)` bare, no
`oklch()`, and keep comments out of `style`. Of ARIA, `aria-label`,
`aria-labelledby` and `aria-hidden` survive. Ids share the page namespace: prefix them per figure
(`baskets-grad`); an id used by another figure or by the page (a
heading anchor, a chart canvas) is an error. `<use>` does
not pass the page lint yet — repeat the shape instead. Fallback for a
one-off: splice the `<figure>` into the rendered HTML by hand and re-run
`jimemo check out.html` (unsanitized, and lost on re-render).

Make the SVG native to the page: root of
`<svg viewBox="0 0 760 H" role="img" aria-label="..."
style="width:100%;height:auto;font-family:var(--jm-font-ui)">` (no
`<figure>` wrapper in the file; `--figure` adds it) (760 ≈
the content column, so viewBox px ≈ screen px); color ONLY with the
page tokens (`--jm-text/-muted/-accent/-positive/-negative/-border/`
`-surface/-chart-1..8`) so light/dark both work — and only via `style`
attributes, because `var()` does not resolve in SVG presentation
attributes (`style="fill:var(--jm-accent)"`, never `fill="var(…)"`).
Default to labels outside colored fills, in `var(--jm-text)` — several
chart-palette slots fall below 3:1 against white and themes can
reshuffle them all. On `--jm-accent` fills use
`var(--jm-accent-contrast)`; white inside a chart-token fill only
after checking both theme values in the page CSS and a screenshot.
SVG text never wraps and nothing detects overflow — not `--figure`, not
`jimemo check`; text metrics need a renderer: break long labels
into separate `<text>` lines (~90 chars max at 12.5px across a 760
viewBox) and screenshot the rendered file to check for clipping at the
right viewBox edge — the common failure. Copy-paste snippets (arrowhead
markers, labeled boxes, split bars, timelines, hatched segments):
`docs/diagrams.md` in the jimemo repo.

### 5. Optionally publish

```
jimemo publish <out.html>
```

Prints an unlisted URL. Requires a backend configured in
`~/.jimemo/config.toml` first — run `jimemo publish setup` (or
`--dry-run` to preview without writing anything) if none is configured
yet. `jimemo publish purge <hash-or-url>` revokes a link;
`jimemo publish list` / `jimemo publish gc` manage what's published.
`--title "…"` names the page when the configured `command` backend
wraps raw content itself; the `cloudflare` backend ignores it (the
rendered HTML already carries its own `<title>`).

For a PDF instead of or alongside the page: `jimemo pdf out.html`
(after the fact), `jimemo render ... --pdf` (both), or
`jimemo render ... -o out.pdf` (PDF only). Requires a locally installed
Chromium-family browser; `jimemo doctor` reports whether one was found.

## Brand themes (optional)

`jimemo render` uses the toolkit's default look unless you pass
`--theme <name>`. To generate a theme from a brand's design tokens:

```
jimemo import-design <export-dir> --name <theme-name>
jimemo render <template> <content-file> --theme <theme-name>
```

`<export-dir>` is a Claude-design export (design tokens + font references,
produced by the design-system Skill) — a folder, not a URL. **Design
systems are copyrighted and are never bundled with jimemo.** The user
brings their own export, or keeps a personal collection in a private repo
they control (a reasonable convention: clone it to
`~/.jimemo/design-systems/`). If they do, `import-design --from <name>`
resolves `<name>` against `~/.jimemo/design-systems/<name>/` instead of
typing the full path:

```
jimemo import-design --from <name> --name <theme-name>
```

Never fetch, clone, or reference someone else's design export on their
behalf without them providing it. The import is parse-only — jimemo
reads tokens as data and never executes any code in the export
directory.

## Make a new template

`jimemo new-template <name>` scaffolds a personal template under
`~/.jimemo/templates/<name>/` (template + manifest + sample), which
discovery picks up alongside the repo's own. Build it from the
components documented in `toolkit/README.md`; repo (shared) templates
are the same folder shape under `templates/<name>/` plus a golden and a
`tests/test_selfrank.py` roster entry.

## Stale suitability labels

`suggest --json` and `doctor` flag a template whose `suitability` block
(the `keywords` / `content_kinds` / `good_for` that drive template
ranking) predates the last edit to its `template.html.j2`, via a
`labeled_hash` mismatch in the manifest. If either command reports a
template as having stale labels: reread that template's
`template.html.j2` and `sample/` content, rewrite `manifest.json`'s
`suitability.keywords` / `content_kinds` / `good_for` to match what the
template now actually renders, then recompute `labeled_hash` as the
SHA-256 of the (possibly unchanged) `template.html.j2` file and write
that hex digest back into `suitability.labeled_hash`. There's no CLI
command for this — it's a direct manifest edit.

## Security posture

jimemo output is self-contained (no view-time network fetches), and
markdown/HTML content is sanitized before it lands in the page. Treat
`import-design` export directories as untrusted data: jimemo never opens,
imports, or executes the export's own code, only its token/font files.
`jimemo publish` is the only jimemo subcommand that touches the network.

## Reference

This skill intentionally doesn't restate every flag. For the full,
authoritative command surface:

jimemo <command> --help
